# CENG455-lab2
The purpose of this project is to write a device terminal driver capable of basic editing and buffering so that type-ahead can be used. The terminal driver must be able to handle data received and transmitted over a serial channel (UART). 
We designed and integrated the ISR for the serial channel with a constantly running handler task.

## Prerequisites
### Hardware
The hardware platform is an NXP/Freescale FRDM-K64F board.

### Software
The software development platform Kinetis Design Studio is used to build, run, and debug your
MQX applications. 

More details are in the report.

## Usage
Run the code on MQX
