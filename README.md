# CENG455-lab2
The purpose of this project is to write a device terminal driver capable of basic editing and buffering so that type-ahead can be used. The terminal driver must be able to handle data received and transmitted over a serial channel (UART). 
We designed and integrated the ISR for the serial channel with a constantly running handler task.
